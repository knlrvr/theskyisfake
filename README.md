## Description & Purpose
The Sky Is Fake is a project that's meant to showcase how beautiful the sky can be. My brother used to say "the sky is fake" whenever it seemed just a little *too* beautiful to be real. My brother passed a few years ago, but I've always loved the sentiment of 'the sky is fake'. I hope to extend that sentiment to anyone who visits the site. Anyone can sign in through a number of platforms (via Clerk) and upload their favorite pictures of the sky to be shown in the gallery. 

You can see my personal favorites on my portfolio at [knlrvr.dev](https://www.knlrvr.dev/tsif).
